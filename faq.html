In accordance with the Regulation of Investment Advice Law (1995), we proactively disclose all our 'Affiliated Alliances'—strategic relationships with financial institutions and fund managers that allows us to deliver added value to our clients.</p>
                        <p>We maintain our professional objectivity and mitigate conflicts through three core pillars:</p>

                            <li style="margin-bottom: var(--space-2);"><strong>A 100% Rebate Policy:</strong> For our clients, FWA credits back all distribution fees (retrocessions) or commissions received from these Affiliated Alliances directly to your account. This ensures our financial interests are perfectly aligned with yours, as we never profit from choosing one manager over another.</li>
                            <li style="margin-bottom: var(--space-2);"><strong>Logistical Advocacy:</strong> We maintain these affiliations specifically to capture institutional-grade terms and discounted share classes that individual investors typically cannot access.</li>
                            <li><strong>Open Architecture:</strong> Regardless of our affiliations, every investment undergoes a rigorous screening process. We only recommend a product—affiliated or otherwise—if it is the absolute best fit for your family's long-term objectives.</li>

                        <p>This structure allows us to offer the flexibility and sophistication of a Family Office, while ensuring that all regulated investment marketing activities are conducted by a licensed professional.

                        <p>While banks and asset managers act as vendors focused on specific products or mandates, FWA acts as your Strategic Architect. We sit on your side of the table to provide holistic management across your entire balance sheet.</p>
                        <p>Instead of replacing these providers, we coordinate them. By leveraging our strategic alliances, we act as an informed bridge to institutional-grade opportunities and terms that are often unavailable to individual private banking clients - ensuring you get the best of the market, fully integrated into your family's long-term strategy.</p>

                        <p>At FWA, we operate exclusively on a Non-Discretionary basis. We believe you should remain the ultimate decision-maker. Our role is to provide the strategy, the education, and the recommendations, but we never execute a trade without your understanding and consent.

Your role is elevated to the executive level: you review clear, simplified recommendations and give the final "green light."</p>
                        <p>While we insist on you being the ultimate authority over your wealth, we ensure the process is efficient. You get the peace of mind of being in the driver's seat, without the burden of having to check the engine yourself.</p>
